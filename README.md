# microlight (or ¬µLight, or ¬µlite, etc)

## Why?

Microlight is a blogging engine based on [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org)-based
concepts. This means support for:

* POSSE (posting on your site, automatically posting to other social media
  sites, and linking the two together)
  * This means comments and replies on those social media websites will
    also appear on your site underneath the post
* Post formats:
  * Note ("tweets")
  * Article (blog posts)
  * Photo
  * Video
  * And more! (See [PostType](https://indieweb.org/Category:PostType))
* Replies
  * Other people with an IndieWeb compatible website will be able to
    post comments on your blog using their own website as an account
* Owning your identity
  * Your website is a corner of the internet **you own** - no company
    keeps a-hold of the information you post to it

## Requirements

* **PHP 7 or above**  
  While in theory microlight should work on PHP 5.6, this version is
  [no longer supported](https://secure.php.net/supported-versions.php) by the
  PHP group, and so I will not be testing it on any version below 7.
* **PDO SQLite/MySQL**  
  Currently, the table creation functions are written purely for SQLite (this
  will be added for MySQL shortly), although fetch posts and inserting posts
  are fully functional using MySQL.
* **GD Image Processing Library**  
  For image uploads. This extension can be enabled in your `php.ini` file, or by
  installing `php-gd`, depending on your distro.
* **Apache or Nginx**  
  To prevent your SQLite database from being directly downloaded, you should run
  microlight in an Apache or Nginx server. In the future, pretty-URL support
  will also be enabled for those doing so, when it is eventually developed.

## Disclaimer

* Whilst in development, microlight has not been tested on a macOS or Windows
  server, only on Arch Linux. Until I have at least confirmed it working on
  Windows, your mileage may vary.
* This is mainly a personal project. I would love suggestions for new features,
  although if they do not align with my goals for this software, I am not likely
  to implement them. You are, of course, welcome to add features by submitting
  a pull request! üòÅ
