# microlight (or µLight, or µlite, etc)

## Why?

Microlight is a blogging engine based on [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org)-based
concepts. This means support for:

* POSSE (posting on your site, automatically posting to other social media
  sites, and linking the two together)
	* This means comments and replies on those social media websites will
	  also appear on your site underneath the post
* Post formats:
	* Note ("tweets")
	* Article (blog posts)
	* Photo
	* Video
	* And more! (See [PostType](https://indieweb.org/Category:PostType))
* Replies
	* Other people with an IndieWeb compatible website will be able to
	  post comments on your blog using their own website as an account
* Owning your identity
	* Your website is a corner of the internet **you own** - no company
	  keeps ahold of the information you post to it

## Requirements

* **PHP v7**
* **MySQL** - may potentially be database agnostic, I haven't gotten that far
  yet though.

## Installation

Will be updated as soon as more is implemented. Right now there's either nothing
here, or not enough to be considered publishable.
